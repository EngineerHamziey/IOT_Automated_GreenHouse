# üåø IoT Automated Greenhouse System Using FreeRTOS

## Project Introduction
An intelligent, self-regulating greenhouse system built using an **ESP32 micro-controller**. It monitors environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity, and automatically controls actuators like a fan, water pump, and lighting for optimal plant growth. Real-time monitoring and control is implemented using **Telegram chat bot**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Micro-controller:** ESP32 Dev Board  
- **Firmware:** Arduino IDE (C/C++)  
- **Communication:** I2C for LCD, GPIOs for sensors and actuators  
- **Telegram Bot:** Improved version from my previous IoT project. started with [Random Nerds tutorial code 3 years ago](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/telegram-control-esp32-esp8266-nodemcu-outputs/), **but I have made a lot of improvements** over the years. Examples of improvements made:
  - I made the code reuseable using more functions and Variables.
  - I added admin management whereby the admin can easily add/authorize or even delete/remove users by adding there telegram chat ID using simple bot command with password and it's saved on esp32 SPIFFS, then it will be loaded during boot/setup.

## üèóÔ∏è Construction Process

> The key stages include:

- Designing a stable transformer-based 5V power supply using: 
  - 12v 1.5A transformer,
  - full-wave bridge rectifier,
  - 100uf 50v filter capacitor and 
  - LM2595 BUCK converter/voltage regulator.
- Soldering the ESP32, sensors, and actuators onto a veroboard using male and female headers when needed.
- Wiring and mounting components inside a PVC enclosure
- Configuring relays with a transistor driver circuit for switching the 200W tungsten built.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Star, then Clone the repository.
1. Remember create the `<secretCredentials.h>` it should look like the example below:
```cpp
// more info on telegram bot using esp32 here: https://randomnerdtutorials.com/telegram-control-esp32-esp8266-nodemcu-outputs/

// secretCredentials.h

// Wi-Fi SSID (network name) used by the device to connect to the internet
#define wifiSsid "your_wifi_name"

// Wi-Fi password for the above SSID
#define wifiPassword "your_wifi_password"

// Telegram Bot Token generated from BotFather
#define botToken "your_bot_token_here"

// Telegram chat ID of the admin user (can be used to restrict access)
#define adminChatId "your_admin_chat_id"

// Password used for authenticating administrative actions (optional)
#define adminPassword "your_admin_password"

```
1. Construct the circuit according to the circuit diagram:

1. Upload the firmware to ESP32 via Arduino IDE 
1. Power system via 220V AC (via transformer + PSU)  
1. Connect to Wi-Fi  
1. Begin receiving live sensor data on LCD and Telegram  
1. Watch as the system automatically adjusts fan, water pump, and lights

## ‚è± Task Scheduling and Architecture

I use **FreeRTOS for task scheduling** for this project because:
- it improves code organization,  
- allows concurrent execution of tasks,  
- ensures timely sensor data acquisition,  
- prevents **blocking operations**,  
- and enhances the system reliability.

Here is how:
- üßæ `Task 1: LCD Display`  
  - Priority: 1  
  - Updates the LCD display in a loop
  - with display delay for each onScreen data being set to 2 seconds using `vTaskDelay(2000/portTICK_PERIOD_MS0;`
  
- üì© `Task 2: Telegram Bot Handler`  
  - Priority: 2  
  - Handles incoming messages from Telegram
  
- üå°Ô∏è `Task 3: Sensor Readings and Actuator Activations`  
  - Priority: 2  
  - Polls all sensors every 2 seconds to ensure timely and accurate data collection, and triggers actuators based on conditions.

## ü§ñ Telegram Bot Integration

This project started as an upgrade from the chatbot used in the previous project:  
**SMART COOKER BURNING PREVENTION SYSTEM WITH IOT INTEGRATION**

### Improvements:
- Better task scheduling using priority-based task separation  
- More stable and faster bot message handling  
- Clearer display of sensor values in chat  
- Ability to control actuators or request logs from chat interface

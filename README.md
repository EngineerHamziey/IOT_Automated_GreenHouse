# IOT ENABLED AUTOMATED GREENHOUSE


## How it's currently going: 
- I started the project by bringing forward and Improving the telegram chatBot Code I used in my last project <b>SMART COOKER BURNING PREVENTION SYSTEM WITH IOT INTEGRATION</b>

## MY PLAN

the loop should be a task for printing to lcd with priority 1, then handleNewMessages should be a task for telegram bot with priority 2 and sensor readings should be gathered with priority 2 every 2 seconds so as not to miss sensor data

## WHAT I HAVE ACHIEVED
- I have improved the telegram V1 code from previous project.
